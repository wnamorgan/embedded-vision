This folder is for collecting data sets with a usb camera. 

Currently, there is a Requirements.t folder that also includes label-studio.

Label-studio is in the process of being pushed into a docker compose file
instead of being run from a python environment so that a ML backend can be used.
When this is complete, label-studio will be removed from this requirements list
